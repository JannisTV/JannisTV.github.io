hello guys. I have one issue with my own skin. I followed step by step this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si3M0SGghbg and it's not working. Maybe I am stupid or smth, idk. My plan was to chainge only the main body of a xbox one controller but I only get a cracked controller when I open my own css URL (https://app.gpv.gg/?p=1&editcss=https%3A%2F%2FJannisTV.github.io%2FFinal+%2Ffinal.css) on the old version and on the newer version is just the notification that this URL (https://JannisTV.github.io/Final /final.css) is not a valid url.
